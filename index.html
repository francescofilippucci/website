  <h2>News from me</h2> 
  <h3><a href="http://francescofilippucci.eu/Filippucci_NEETs.pdf">My Job Market Paper</a> was awarded the FBK-IRVAPP Best Paper in Policy Evaluation award</h3>
  <p>
  <img src="img/gj.png" ALIGN="right" width="400" height="480"> The paper, titled "What Do NEETs Need?
	The Joint Effect of Active and Passive Labor Market Policies" first investigates the effect of combining intensive training, job immersions and counseling with a generous cash transfer. 
  Ido so by evaluating a flagship French program, <i>Garantie Jeunes</i>, targeting disadvantaged youth Not in Employment, Education or Training.  Using a new diff-in-diff estimator, I find that active labor market policies compensae for lock-in and for the negative effect of passive policies during the program, while a stong positive effect emerges after the end of the program.

  <h3>My paper "Did Covid-19 hit harder in peripheral areas? The case of Italian municipalities" got published on Economics and Human Biology</h3>
  <img src="_includes\img\Capture.JPGextra_march_by_classe.png" ALIGN="right" width="400" height="480"> In this work, joint with Francesco Armillei (Bocconi University) and Thomas Fletcher (University of Edinburgh), I analyze the geographically heterogeneous impact of Covid-19. Exploiting a triple-differences methodology, we find that in Italy Covid-19 hit relatively harder in peripheral areas: the excess mortality in peripheral areas was almost double that of central ones in March 2020 (1.2 additional deaths every 1000 inhabitants). 
  We leverage the rich dataset of the <a href="https://www.localopportunitieslab.it/">Local Opportunities Lab</a> to explore mechanisms behind this gradient.
