  <h3><a href="http://francescofilippucci.eu/Filippucci_NEETs.pdf">My Job Market Paper</a> was awarded the FBK-IRVAPP Best Paper in Policy Evaluation award</h3>

  <img src="img\gj.png" ALIGN="right" width="400" height="480"> The paper, titled "What Do NEETs Need?
	The Joint Effect of Active and Passive Labor Market Policies" first investigates the effect of combining intensive training, job immersions and counseling with a generous cash transfer. 
  Ido so by evaluating a flagship French program, <i>Garantie Jeunes</i>, targeting disadvantaged youth Not in Employment, Education or Training.  Using a new diff-in-diff estimator, I find that active labor market policies compensae for lock-in and for the negative effect of passive policies during the program, while a stong positive effect emerges after the end of the program.
